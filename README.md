# Japan Stores Web

A real-world front-end project showcasing a web directory of Japanese stores.  
The project is currently **in development**, but already includes functional layout and visual structure. It was created as part of my personal learning journey in front-end development.

## Project Purpose

This project is based on real content and was developed to:

- Practice building a full front-end website from scratch
- Improve design implementation based on Figma mockups
- Explore basic front-end structure for store directories
- Develop reusable layout blocks for future projects

**Current Status:** In development  
Core structure and styling are in place. Further improvements and interactive features are planned.

## Features

- Real example content (store names, categories)
- Clean UI with navigation bar and store sections
- Static front-end structure ready for backend/API integration
- Simple and understandable codebase

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (basic)
- Figma (for design and layout)
